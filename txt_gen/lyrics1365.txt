(My heart is beating, keeps on repeating
I am waiting for you ) \- à¥¨
My love encloses, a plot of roses,
And when shall be then, our next meeting,
'Cos love (extended) you know,
That time is fleeting, ... (3 times,  3rd time is longer)
Oh, when I look at you,
The blue of heaven seems to be deeper blue,
And I can say that,
God Himself, seems to be looking through (hoo-hoo),
Zu-zu-zu---zu-ru-zu,    (that's what it sounds like)
I'll never part from you,
And if it is so, when are we meeting,
'Cos love, you know,
That time is fleeting, time is fleeting, time is fleeting.
Spring is the season,
That rolls the reason of lovers who are truly true,
Young birds are mating,
while I am waiting for you (hoo-hoo)
Darling you haunt me,
say do you want me?
And if it so, when are we meeting,
'Cos love you know,
That time is fleeting, time is fleeting, time is fleeting.
My heart is beating...
