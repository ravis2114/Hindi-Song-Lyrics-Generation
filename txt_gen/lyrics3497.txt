पैसा ही पाप है
पैसा ही भाई बहन
पैसा माई बाप है
पैसा है तो यार है
पैसा है तो प्यार है
पैसा ही नसीब है
पैसा ही हबीब है
पैसा है तो नाम है
पैसा है तो काम है
पैसा खनकता है
पैसा चमकता है
पैसा महकता है
पैसा छनकता है
पैसा ह ह ह हँसाता है
पैसा ऊँ रुलाता है
पैसा जगाता है
पैसा सुलाता है
पैसा ही गाता है
पैसा नचाता है
